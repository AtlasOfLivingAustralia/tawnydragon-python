Introduction To The Available Standards
========================================

Below are the six available "standards" from TDWG.  These standards are a way of describing 
particular kinds of data, and we provide a brief introduction to help you make the decision of 
which standard to use for your data.

Darwin Core
---------------

This is the standard that you will most likely use, as this is meant for species occurrence records.  
This can include observations, specimens, and samples of taxa, as well as other related information.  
These can also be extended to include multimedia, using the ``multimedia`` extension (for those who 
have images, videos and sounds of their species), as well as something called an ``eventCore``.  

An ``eventCore`` describes one or more of a series of ``events``, such as surveys, visits to a specific 
site several times, bio blitzes and the like.  This is meant to show the occurrences of species over time,
and is quite useful to observe changes over time.

*Official description as per `TDWG <https://www.tdwg.org/standards/dwc/>`_: Darwin Core is a standard 
maintained by the Darwin Core maintenance group. It includes a glossary of terms (in other contexts 
these might be called properties, elements, fields, columns, attributes, or concepts) intended to 
facilitate the sharing of information about biological diversity by providing identifiers, labels, 
and definitions. Darwin Core is primarily based on taxa, their occurrence in nature as documented 
by observations, specimens, samples, and related information.*

Audiovisual Core
-----------------

These terms are relevant for those who have data that comes under the category of "audio" or "visual".  
This standard includes terms such as X.

*Official description as per `TDWG <https://www.tdwg.org/standards/ac/>`_: The Audiovisual Core (AC) is a set of vocabularies designed to represent metadata for biodiversity 
multimedia resources and collections. These vocabularies aim to represent information that will help 
to determine whether a particular resource or collection will be fit for some particular biodiversity 
science application before acquiring the media. Among others, the vocabularies address such concerns 
as the management of the media and collections, descriptions of their content, their taxonomic, 
geographic, and temporal coverage, and the appropriate ways to retrieve, attribute and reproduce them.*

Standards Documentation Standard (SDS)
-----------------------------------------

**Coming soon!**

These terms are relevant for those who are interested in the hierarchy and standards of current and previous 
Darwin Core Terms.  It also includes details about how these are supposed to be represented.

*Official description as per `TDWG <https://www.tdwg.org/standards/sds/>`_: The TDWG Standards Documentation 
Standard consists of a single document: the Standards Documentation Specification. That document defines how 
TDWG standards are to be presented. It provides details about the hierarchical structure of standards and 
versioning of standards components. It specifies how the properties of standards and their components are to 
be described in human-readable and machine-readable terms.*

Vocabulary Maintenance Standard (VMS)
--------------------------------------

**Coming soon!**

These terms are relevant for those who are interested in how TDWG maintains their vocabulary.

*Official description as per `TDWG <https://www.tdwg.org/standards/ac/>`_: TDWG vocabularies are a collection 
of standardized terms and their definitions. Vocabulary standards differ from other Biodiversity Information 
Standards (TDWG) standards in that they are likely to change more often over time as they evolve to meet the 
changing needs of the biodiversity informatics community. These changes may be incremental, making it 
impractical to apply the full TDWG standards process to every change. The TDWG Vocabulary Maintenance 
Specification details the categories of changes that can be made to a TDWG vocabulary standard, the mechanisms 
used to achieve those changes, and the entities that are responsible for shepherding those changes through the 
process.*

GUID and LIfe Sciences Identifiers Applicability Statements
------------------------------------------------------------

**Coming soon!**

These terms are relevant for those who are interested in generating Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs) to 
meet specific standards.

*Official description as per `TDWG <https://www.tdwg.org/standards/guid-as/>`_: The TDWG GUID Applicability 
Statement 1) provides guidance on how to use GUIDs (Globally Unique Identifiers) to meet specific requirements 
of the biodiversity information community; 2) applies to GUIDs in general; there is, or will be, a separate 
document for the applicability of each specific GUID technology. The LSID (Life Sciences Applicability 
Statement) describes how to use that technology.*

TDWG Access Protocol for Information Retrieval (TAPIR)
------------------------------------------------------

**Coming soon!**

These terms are relevant for those who use TAPIR.  TAPIR acts as a large database for searching many disparate 
data providers.

*Official description as per `TDWG <https://www.tdwg.org/standards/tapir/>`_: TAPIR is a computer protocol 
designed for discovery, search and retrieval of distributed data over the Internet. TAPIR consists of a 
specification that determines how client applications seeking information should communicate with server 
applications hosting data. TAPIR is an approved TDWG standard.*

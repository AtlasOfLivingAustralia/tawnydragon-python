A Guide to the Vocabulary of Biodiversity
==========================================

For those of you new to the world of standardising biodiversity data, welcome!  This is 
our attempt at walking you through the six data standards provided by the `Taxonomic 
Database Working Group (TDWG) <tdwg.org>`_.  In short, this group "develops and promotes 
standards and guidelines for the recording and exchange of data about organisms".  This 
functions to standardise data sharing and lessen confusion about shared information.  In 
this section, we will walk you through an introduction to these standards, as well as 
explaining what is required and recommended in the context of preparing your own data.
